#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
--Software engineering involves the design, development, and maintainance of software solutions. Software engineering makes use of engineering skills and knowledge of programming to build softwares that match end user requirements. In the technology industry, software engineering is important because it helps in creating large and scalable software solutions. This makes sure that the software can handle user(s) demands and can be maintained over time without major issues.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
--Requirement Analysis: Understanding and documenting what the software needs to do.
--Design: Planning how the software will be structured and how it will meet the requirements.
--Implementation: Writing the actual code based on the design.
--Testing: Checking the software for bugs and verifying it meets the requirements.
--Deployment: Releasing the software to users.
--Maintenance: Updating and fixing the software as needed after itâ€™s been released.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
--Waterfall:
    A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as infrastructure projects. For example, developing a management system for customer relations.
--Agile:
    An iterative approach that allows for changes and adaptations throughout the development process. It is suitable for projects where requirements may evolve or are not fully known at the start, such as developing a new app where user feedback will shape future features. E.g. Creating a new social media app where user feedback and trends influence development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
--Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, develops new features, and ensures the software meets user requirements.
--Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests the software to find and fix bugs, ensuring it meets quality standards and performs as expected.
--Project Manager: Oversees the project, manages timelines and resources, communicates with stakeholders, and ensures the project stays on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
--Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
    To provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing within a single interface, such that development can be more efficient. Example: Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA.
--Version Control Systems (VCS):
    To track changes to the codebase, manage different versions of the software, and facilitate collaboration among developers. Example: Git, Subversion (SVN).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
--Unit Testing: Tests individual components of the software to ensure each one functions correctly. It helps identify and fix issues early in the development process.
--Integration Testing: Tests how different components of the software work together. It ensures that combined components function as expected.
--System Testing: Tests the complete and integrated software system. It validates the overall behavior and performance of the software.
--Acceptance Testing: Tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets their needs. It confirms that the software is ready for release and meets user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
--Prompt engineering involves creating effective prompts to better interact/communicate with AI models.
When it comes to prompt engineering, well-done prompts help the AI in providing precise answers, and reducing vagueness.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Tell me about Climate Change
Improved: Explain the impact of climate change on tropical cities in the next 50 years.
The improved prompt specifies the topic to "impact of climate change" and narrows it down to "tropical cities", making it less vague. It gives a time frame and the prompt is straight to the point which helps the AI to give a more precise answer.
